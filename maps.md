# 1. Maps

1. The team with the higher average score in the previous round gets to pick the first map. After this, map selection alternates between teams. For the first round of a tournament, tournament officials will flip a coin and notify which team gets the first map pick.
2. No map can be selected twice in a best of three series. In a best of five, the first three maps played must all differ.

The following maps are allowed to be played:

|             | Siena | Castel Gandolfo | Venice | San Donato\* | Rome | Forli | Florence | Mont St-Michel | Pienza | Alhambra | Monteriggioni |

## Unfair Spawns in Escort

#### Siena

If either team spawns on the green side of the map, the game must be remade.

#### General

If the initial VIP spawn is such that the defending team cannot possibly reach the VIPs before the attacking team, the defenders must leave the match and the game replayed. Failure to leave implies the team is okay with this disadvantage and must accept the game's outcome.
